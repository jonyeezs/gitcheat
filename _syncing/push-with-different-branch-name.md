# Push with different branch name

```git push origin <local-name>:<remote-name>```

Your local branch name doesn't really describe its intention. Push your newly created local branch with a new name.

Then rename it because the names are different it can be confusing for your mental juggle.

```git branch -m <remote-name>```
