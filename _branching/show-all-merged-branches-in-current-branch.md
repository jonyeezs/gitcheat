# Show all completely merged branches in current branch

```git branch --merged```

**Note: only works if you have the branches tracked locally**

# Remote branch not up to date with original forked-from branch

You'll most probably see an error, something in the fashion of:

> Branch is behind forked blah blah blah

Follow [these instructions on this link](https://github.com/jonyeezs/gitreference/wiki/Syncing#sync-with-a-forked-branch) before trying to continue with your work
