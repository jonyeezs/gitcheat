<p>Not much of a "<em>cheatsheet</em>" as there's more contents here than you'd wish for a chit.</p>

<p>But this would be alot of scenarios that I encountered, and had to SO-ed it; so this is more like a compile of useful git things.</p>

<p><code>&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code> is the name of the remote branch. </p>

<p>If you want to know what the naming convention of your branch is, type in <code>git branch -r</code>. You usually wouldn't need to type in origin/.... Just the remote branch name.</p>

<p><code>origin</code> is an alias on your system for a particular remote repository. It's not actually a property of that repository.</p>
