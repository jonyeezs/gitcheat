Look at [references.md](https://github.com/jonyeezs/gitcheat/blob/master/images/references.md) in the image folder for the citations._\r\n\r\nNot much of a \"_cheatsheet_\" as there's more contents here than you'd wish for a chit.\r\n\r\nBut this would be alot of scenarios that I encountered, and had to SO-ed it; so this is more like a compile of useful git things.\r\n\r\n## Git Overview\r\n\r\nHere's a few links to understand concept of git better:\r\n\r\n* [git transport (or the different stages of git)](https://github.com/jonyeezs/gitcheat/wiki/Git-Transport-Overview)\r\n\r\n## Common conventions\r\n`<remote>/<branch>` is the name of the remote branch. \r\n\r\nIf you want to know what the naming convention of your branch is, type in `git branch -r`. You usually wouldn't need to type in origin/.... Just the remote branch name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`origin` is an alias on your system for a particular remote repository. It's not actually a property of that repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Some Cool websites\r\n[Visualized git examples](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3)\r\n\r\n[Git Reflow - simplify your git process with easy commands](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow)\r\n\r\n[Moar git tips](https://github.com/git-tips/tips#show-helpful-guides-that-come-with-git)\r\n\r\n[Very very useful git alias](https://hackernoon.com/lesser-known-git-commands-151a1918a60#.iqyqz0w0p). I'm not even gonna copy this into my references because this is worthwhile looking on your own.\r\n\r\n[Git Extras - An extension to your Git commands](https://github.com/tj/git-extras)\r\n",
